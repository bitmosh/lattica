# Blast Radius — Pass 10.0.t (v0.10.0t)

## Files

### Modified
- `docs/implement/AGENT_TRACE_VOCABULARY.md` — substantial addition: Consumer Extension Registry (new §2), Cerebra extension event types (new §7, 22 events), OTel §8.2 Cerebra mapping (22 rows + span hierarchy notes); all prior sections renumbered §3–§9; 382 → ~750 lines
- `docs/aseptic/POLISH_DEBT.md` — PD-005 added (naming convention inconsistency); `last_reviewed` bumped to v0.10.0t
- `docs/aseptic/TECH_DEBT.md` — `last_reviewed` bumped to v0.10.0t
- `docs/aseptic/README.md` — version bumped to v0.10.0t

### Created
- `docs/aseptic/blast-radius/pass-10.0.t.md` — this file
- `docs/aseptic/cross-pollination/pass-10.0.t.md` — Cerebra (primary) + LumaWeave + Policy Scout/Bo/ai-stack

## Editorial decisions

**Section numbering:** Consumer Extension Registry placed as §2 (after intro, before any consumer sections) per pass prompt — it serves as a discoverability aid. All prior sections shifted by one (§2→§3, §3→§4, etc.). Cerebra landed as §7 (before OTel §8).

**Registry rows §5 and §6:** Both sections existed at §4 and §5 (now §5 and §6). Used real section links — no "(vocabulary pending)" placeholders needed.

**OTel mapping treatment:** Extended existing §8 (was §6) by renaming the standard 5-row table to §8.1 and adding new §8.2 for Cerebra's 22 events. Added ancillary notes: span hierarchy (session > cycle > step), re-injection span links, cardinality exclusion for `checklist_details`, and `gen_ai.cerebra.*` namespace convention.

**StepExecutionFailed discrepancy:** Pass prompt listed 23 events including `StepExecutionFailed` in the "Step execution" group. The contribution document at `lattica/docs/adjacent-project-info/cerebra_phase6_event_vocabulary.md` defines only 22 event types — `StepExecutionFailed` has no schema. Folded the 22 defined events; `StepExecutionFailed` was not added (no fabricated schema). This discrepancy should be resolved with Cerebra Claude — `StepExecutionFailed` may be a Phase 7/8 addition not yet specified.

**ContextPacketBuilt overlap vs "StepStarted overlap flag":** The contribution document explicitly names `ContextPacketBuilt` as the event that also exists in pre-Phase-6 retrieval flow. The pass prompt mentioned "StepStarted overlap flag" in the registry description. The `ContextPacketBuilt` overlap is the documented one; `StepStarted` has no explicit overlap documentation. Registry overlap column reflects `ContextPacketBuilt` as the named overlap.

**Formatting adaptation:** Cerebra's contribution used a bullet-list format for Required/Optional payload fields. The existing doc uses JSON code blocks with `//` comments. Cerebra's payload content was adapted to the doc's JSON code block style. All field names, types, and descriptions were preserved; only presentation changed.

**Cerebra stream pattern lock:** Used exact phrasing from Cerebra's contribution where possible, per the pass prompt instruction that "the language is the contract."
